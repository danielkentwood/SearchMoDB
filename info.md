#### What is this app?
The [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng) (formerly known as Mormons) has a biannnual conference known as General Conference. It is the primary vehicle through which the leadership of the LDS Church provides encouragement, moral guidance and correction, and doctrinal exposition. 

I made this little app to help me investigate trends in how the church leadership speaks to the members, and how those trends have changed (or remained the same) over time. It lets you search through a database containing the archives of General Conference talks from 1942 to the present day.

#### Hits vs Probability
You can select hits to see the raw number of hits for your search term(s). However, some years had more words overall than others; it is sometimes more informative to see the probability (hits divided by total # of words) of your search term(s). Hint: If you choose hits, it makes sense to set the smoothing slider to 0.

### Smoothing
When comparing multiple search terms, sometimes the raw data are so noisy that it is hard to make out the separate lines. Smoothing discards some detail and keeps the gist; this makes the plot easier to parse perceptually.
