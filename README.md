The [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng) 
(formerly known as Mormons)
has a biannnual conference known as General Conference. It is the primary 
vehicle through which the leadership of the LDS Church provides encouragement, 
moral guidance and correction, and doctrinal exposition. 

I made this little app to help me investigate trends in how the church leadership speaks
to the members, and how those trends have changed (or remained the same) over time.

** HOW TO USE THE APP: **

To use the app, just add a search term in the "ADD OPTION" box and then click the button.
Your search term will now appear in the pulldown menu below. Select your search term(s)
and watch as the chart updates. 

I hope you find this little project useful.
